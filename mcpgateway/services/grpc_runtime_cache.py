Process-local runtime cache for outbound gRPC connections.

Industrial gRPC workloads call ``invoke_method`` in a tight loop (one MCP tool
call per upstream RPC). Every call used to build a fresh ``GrpcEndpoint``: a new
``Channel`` plus a private ``DescriptorPool`` populated from stored schema
descriptors, then torn down with ``channel.close()``. That per-call allocation is
the dominant cost at low-to-moderate concurrency.

This module caches the reusable pieces -- ``Channel``, ``DescriptorPool`` and the
derived message classes -- keyed by ``(service_id, schema_hash, connection
fingerprint)`` so a schema activation or a service configuration change naturally
invalidates the entry. See :mod:`mcpgateway.translate_grpc` for the caller.

Design constraints:

* Process-level only. No distributed coordination; each gateway worker keeps its
  own entries and a service change on one worker does not purge another until
  that worker's next lookup observes the new hash/fingerprint.
* Bounded. ``_GRPC_RUNTIME_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`` caps the number of live entries.
  Evicted channels are closed only once they are no longer referenced by an
  in-flight invocation, so a slow upstream cannot be torn down under a running
  call.
* Refcount-safety. ``acquire``/``release`` pairs the caller (``invoke_method``)
  must balance, even on exception, so ``close`` of an evicted channel never
  races an active call.
* Event-loop affine.  The cached channel is a ``grpc.aio.Channel`` (design
  §53), which binds to the event loop it was created on.  The loop identity is
  folded into the cache key, so two loops in one process never share a channel;
  each gets its own entry.  Closing an aio channel is a coroutine, so eviction
  schedules the close on the owning loop instead of blocking the cache lock.
